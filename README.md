According to the EPA, extreme precipitation events in the lower 48 states have gone up in severity each year although the frequency of such events have remained roughly the same. [1] They also said that the proportion of land in the lower 48 states that experiences severe precipitation events increased over time. They also found that the 

The EPA uses the Standardized Precipitation Index which compares yearly precipitation totals with the range of precipitation totals one would expect at a locations based on historical data. It was found that a higher air temperature caused by the addition of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere [2] and other factors change rainfall patterns.  

This project is designed to analyze how rainfall patterns have changed in Singapore as a response to multiple other factors to note how climate change is driving changes in key environmental markers over time. Anecdotal data from talking to Singaporeans have shown that rainfall in Singapore is becoming more intense, if shorter and temperatures when not raining are higher than ever. The data obtained for this project is from Singapore government sources and will be described in more detail below. 

*Datasets currently catalogues*
1. Rainfall data

*Future datasets*
1. [] Temperature
2. [] $CO_2$ concentration
3. [] Air Quality Index (AQI)

## Goals

The aim of this project is to improve insight into 
1. Machine learning
2. API based data retrieval
3. Data visualization strategies and methods
4. Sorting large sets of data

## API Reference

The Singapore governments data portal found [here](https://data.gov.sg/) is used to obtain all data. Examples of how to use the API and links to various datasets are found within the each dataset type although a light tutorial will be furnished in the raw data collection notebook.
